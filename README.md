Our mission is to enable everyone to deploy and run resilient, secure and performant protocol infrastructure.

In the world of software, you usually need to decide between using a managed SaaS or running everything yourself in a self-hosted environment, which means handling all the operations to keep things running smoothly. At kuutamo we believe that there is a better way. A hybrid cloud first way. A next generation cloud. Our packaged services can be deployed anywhere, to any cloud, bare metal, and to our users own infrastructure. We aim to provide all the updates, monitoring and ops tooling needed, along with world-class SRE for protocol and infrastructure support services.

# NEAR Staking Node using kneard from kuutamo

## Prerequisites

- Server/node: Any Linux OS
- Workstation/development machine: Any Linux OS

These are two different machines. The kneard manager, `kneard-mgr` will run on your workstation. It will talk over SSH to your server/node. During install the server/node will be wiped and a fresh kuutamo near distribution will be installed onto it.


## Server Setup

You will need a server with any Linux OS installed. You will need SSH root access with a key. 

We have validated:

- [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/bare-metal/advance/adv-1/) - Advance 1 Gen 2, 64GB RAM, 2 x 960GB NVMe, with Ubuntu

Before [installing Ubuntu on the server](https://support.us.ovhcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001775950-How-to-Install-an-OS-on-a-Dedicated-Server), [add your workstation SSH key](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/dedicated/creating-ssh-keys-dedicated/#importing-your-ssh-key-into-the-ovhcloud-control-panel_1).

- [Latitude](https://www.latitude.sh/features) - c3.medium.x86, with Ubuntu

Before [installing Ubuntu on the server](https://docs.latitude.sh/docs/deployments-and-reinstalls#deploying-a-server), [add your workstation SSH key](https://docs.latitude.sh/docs/ssh#adding-your-ssh-key).


## Workstation Setup

1. Install the Nix package manager, if you don't already have it. https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install is an excellent resource.

2. Enable `nix` command and [flakes](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-25-flakes/) features:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/nix/ && printf 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

3. Trust pre-built binaries (optional):

```bash
$ printf 'trusted-substituters = https://cache.garnix.io https://cache.nixos.org/\ntrusted-public-keys = cache.garnix.io:CTFPyKSLcx5RMJKfLo5EEPUObbA78b0YQ2DTCJXqr9g= cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=' | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf && sudo systemctl restart nix-daemon
```

4. Alias `kneard-mgr` and use [`nix run`](https://determinate.systems/posts/nix-run) command:

```bash
$ printf 'alias kneard-mgr="nix run --refresh github:kuutamolabs/near-staking-knd --"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```
5. Test the `kneard-mgr` command:

```bash
$ kneard-mgr --help
```

Answer ‘y’ to the four questions asked.
After some downloading you should see the help output.

```bash
Subcommand to run

Usage: kneard-mgr [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  generate-config  Generate NixOS configuration
  install          Install Validator on a given machine. This will remove all data of the current system!
  dry-update       Upload update to host and show which actions would be performed on an update
  update           Update validator
  rollback         Rollback validator
  proxy            Proxy remote rpc to local
  restart          Schedule a restart in a window where no blocks or chunks are expected to be produced by the validator
  ssh              SSH into a host
  help             Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --config <CONFIG>  configuration file to load [env: KUUTAMO_CONFIG=] [default: kneard.toml]
      --yes              skip interactive dialogs by assuming the answer is yes
  -h, --help             Print help
  -V, --version          Print version

```

## New Solo node install 

1. New pool deployments can be done via the webapp UI `Get Started` flow at [near.kuutamo.app](https://near.kuutamo.app) - ([GitHub](https://github.com/kuutamolabs/near-staking-ui))

2. Download encrypted kuutamo app key file, config file (`kneard.toml`) and an optional monitoring access token (`kuutamo-monitoring.token`) via `Manage` button in UI: (here are [example](example)). The example file is generated by `kneard-mgr generate-example`.

3. Create a new directory and put these files in it.

```
[you@workstation:~/my-near-validator-1/]$ ls
my-pool.pool.devnet.zip  kneard.toml
```

4. In this directory run:

```bash
$ kneard-mgr install
```

2. After this install finishes you can connect to the node.

```bash
$ kneard-mgr ssh
```

3. Follow the logs

```bash
[root@validator-00:~]$ journalctl -u kuutamod.service
```

## Node upgrades

In the folder:

```bash
$ kneard-mgr update
```

## Monitoring Settings

Although monitoring is not mandatory for deploying a node, it is highly recommended. By setting up monitoring, you can easily track metrics and identify potential issues.

To set up monitoring for your node, you can use the Kuutamo monitoring token. The process is simple - just obtain the token and configure your node to send metrics to the Kuutamo monitor. By default, the token file name is `kuutamo-monitoring.token`, and the default monitoring server is `https://mimir.monitoring-00-cluster.kuutamo.computer`.

If you have multiple hosts in `kneard.toml` and want to use different tokens for each host, you can set the `kuutamo_monitoring_token_file` field for each host to point to the desired token file.

Alternatively, if you prefer to self-monitor the node, you can customize your monitor server by setting the `self_monitoring_url`, `self_monitoring_username`, and `self_monitoring_password` fields of the host. The `self_monitoring_url` should implement [Prometheus's Remote Write API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write).
